        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website, I am Natasha. I have a few of my favorite projects listed and a little more information about myself. </p>
        <h3>Purpose, Goals, and Objectives</h3>
        <p>This website has been designed for you to learn a little more about my design process. I’ve worked on some very interesting projects and look forward to sharing how I approached the challenges to provide optimal outcomes for stakeholders. I’ve highlighted a few of my favorite projects. Each project has been broken down to allow you to quickly look through the website, while providing opportunity to take a deeper dive on anything of interest. I’ve highlkighted the skills used to reach the end result. I’ve worked both on a team and independently, and have the ability to do either as needed. I understand how to take an idea from conception to practice and enjoy the process of using various techniques for the most appropriate outcomes. </p>
