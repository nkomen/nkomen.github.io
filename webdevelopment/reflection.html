            Much of my life has led up to educating those around me. In order to keep myself afloat while living abroad I taught english. It started as a way to make money, but I found I enjoyed finding unique and interesting ways to communicate with my students. When I would visit home, I would put together videos or slideshows to try to encapsulate my experiences into a few minutes. It was a way for me to share my experiences, but also to invite others into what I had learned in my time away. I found I enjoyed using media--photos, videos, audio, and more--to portray these experiences. 
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            As my time living abroad came to an end I began to fully pursue my undergraduate degree. Something about the sciences drew me, so I started as a biology major. After two years, I realized that while I had enjoyed what I had learned, it wasnâ€™t ultimately going to be for me. I spoke to many professors I had built relationship with and they agreed that shifting gears would probably be most appropriate. I was encouraged to pursue writing. After graduation, I pursued jobs that would would allow me to write. I eventually ended up Costco which quickly led me to joining their Content team. 
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            My time on the content team was extremely valuable. My teammates and I held our work to a high standard which allowed us to learn from one another and produce high quality work. This created more opportunities within the call center and I was able to be part of two major projects--redesigning the Costco Customer Service website, and building standard operating procedure websites for the various departments in the call center. 
        </p>
        <p class="p4">
            These experiences and projects made me want more. When these projects came to an end, I decided to move on in hopes of new projects that would give me similar expereinces. I joined a small business that had been recently purchased by a new owner who wanted to make some changes. Not all the changes we talked about came to light, but I have still found my time valuable. Pursuing my Master of Science with the Learning Technology and Design program will I think funnel much of my experience into bettering my skills so that I can move full time into instructional design. 
        </p>
        <p class="p5">
            Looking back, I see a lot of my experiences attributing to my current abilities. My background in teaching various ages, cultures, and languages has created a wide familiarity in best communication practices. Being familiar with the scientific method and scientific reasoning has allowed me to be detail oriented and clear when developing instructions. 
        </p>
        <p class="p6">
            Writing is a very valuable skill when it comes to instructional design. Then my experiences working on the content development team at Costco and working at a small business that is built around classes and teaching adult learners. I look forward to continuing to build up my abilities to pursue work that truly interests me.
