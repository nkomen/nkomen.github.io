          Hello, my name is Natasha and I’m about an hour south of Seattle, WA. I have very minimal experience in web application or development, but am excited to learn! Through this course, I hope to gain better understanding and skills that I can leverage to move up in my career. I’d like to break into instructional design, and my technical skills could be stronger. 
My hobby is dog sports, but my favorite sport is Agility. This time of year, most of my weekends are spent at trials running my boxer, pug, and friend’s sheltie.
